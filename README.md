This repository contains the official implementation of AsymFormer, a novel network for real-time RGB-D semantic segmentation.

- Achieves efficient and precise RGBD semantic segmentation
- Allows effective fusion of multimodal features at low computational cost
- Minimizes superfluous parameters by optimizing computational resource distribution
- Enhances network accuracy through feature selection and multi-modal self-similarity features
- Utilizes Local Attention-Guided Feature Selection (LAFS) module for selective fusion
- Introduces Cross-Modal Attention-Guided Feature Correlation Embedding (CMA) module for cross-modal representations

## Results

AsymFormer achieves competitive results on the following datasets:
- NYUv2: 52.0% mIoU
- SUNRGBD: 49.1% mIoU

Notably, it also provides impressive inference speeds:
- Inference speed of 65 FPS on RTX3090
- Inference speed of 79 FPS on RTX3090 (FP16)
- Inference speed of 29 FPS on Tesla T4 (FP16)
